This talk was given for the Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) symposium at the University of Virginia where undergraduates present their research. It consisted of a presentation followed Q&A where I presented on my quantum mechanics oriented undergraduate project that I also wrote [my thesis](https://mohan-s1.github.io/publications/2024-04-19-undergrad-thesis/) on. In short, the goal is to develop a system describing quantum effusion to create a baseline model which quantum transition state (QTST) theories can be measured against, analagous to how classic TST used classical effusion as its model. Students in the DMP also had to create and present a poster at the regional ACS meeting.

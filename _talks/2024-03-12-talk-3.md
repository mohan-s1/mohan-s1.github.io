Group theory is an incredibly elegant theory despite its somewhat dry mathematical definition: *group theory is the study of algebraic structures known as groups*. 
The main focus of the talk will be the of permutaion of three numbers denoted P(3) and the symmetry operations of an equilateral triangle, showing how these two are connected using group theory.
Following this, a slight mention of group theory's application in cryptography was made.

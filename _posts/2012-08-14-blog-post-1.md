This page came default with this template. I'm not sure if I'll do anything with it, but I'm leaving it up as an option right now. Currently, I think I'll use it as a place for me to store "notes" from classes I've taken or content I've consumed. I think GitHhub Pages supports LaTeX syntax, so that could make my life easier if true.

**The Ising Model**


$$ E_{\nu} = -H \sum_{i}^{N} s_i  -J \sum_{ \left< i, j\right> }^{N}  ' s_i s_j $$

Note that <i, j> means sum over nearest neighbors.
**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

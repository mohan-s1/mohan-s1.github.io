This page came default with this template. I'm not sure if I'll do anything with it, but I'm leaving it up as an option right now. Currently, I think I'll use it as a place for me to store "notes" from classes I've taken or content I've consumed. I think GitHhub Pages supports LaTeX syntax, so that could make my life easier if so.

$$ \sum_{i}^{N} -H s_i $$

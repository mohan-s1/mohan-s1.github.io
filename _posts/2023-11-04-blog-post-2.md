# Background 

As a chemistry major at UVa, I've had the chance to take a wide variety of classes that introduced me to a variety of topics I didn't know I'd be interested in let alone that they exist. A prime example of this is group theory which is used in Inorganic Chemistry to describe the **necessary** symmetry atomic orbitals must possess in order to form bonds. The notion of symmetry is introduced at a young age, yet we tend to disregard it as we get older. That is a grave mistake. 

Symmetry pervades some of the most important theories and results of math and science making seemingly impossible problems solvableâ€” providing elegant explanations to fundamental questions. All conservation laws in physics, for example, are based on symmetry of particular action. Time translational symmetry leads to energy conservation. Conservation of linear momentum stems from spatial-translation symmetry. Rotational symmetries to conserving angular momentum. There are many more.

Perhaps the two fields that pique my interest the most lie in quantum mechanics (QM) and statistical mechanics (SM) due their uncanny ability to explain very fundamental things. The math pervading the two are consequently very cool and fascinating.

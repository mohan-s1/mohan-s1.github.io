# Background 

As a result of *A Compact History of* $\infty$ by David Foster-Wallace and *Gödel, Escher, Bach* 
by Douglas Hofstadter, I've been thinking about set theory, infinity, and paradox in math for a bit now. In particular, Foster-Wallace's
book considers the work of Georg Cantor. 

# Set Theory's Basics

I'll be cribbing liberally from Richard Hammack's *Book of Proof* as I found it to be the most useful, succint description for Set Theory and the fundamentals of it. 

## Hammack's *Book of Proof*

"A **set** is a collection of things. The things are called **elements** of the set. We
are mainly concerned with sets whose elements are mathematical entities, such as numbers, points, functions, etc.

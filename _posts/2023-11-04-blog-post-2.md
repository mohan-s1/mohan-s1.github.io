# Background 

As a result of *A Compact History of* $\infty$ by David Foster-Wallace and *Gödel, Escher, Bach* 
by Douglas Hofstadter, I've been thinking about set theory, infinity, and paradox in math for a bit now. In particular, Foster-Wallace's
book considers the work of Georg Cantor. 

# Set Theory's Basics

I'll be cribbing liberally from Richard Hammack's *Book of Proof* as I found it to be the most useful, succint description for Set Theory and the fundamentals of it. 

## Hammack's *Book of Proof*

"A **set** is a collection of things. The things are called **elements** of the set. We
are mainly concerned with sets whose elements are mathematical entities, such as numbers, points, functions, etc.

A set is often expressed by listing its elements between commas, enclosed
by braces. For example, the collection {2,4,6,8} is a set which has four
elements, the numbers 2,4,6 and 8. Some sets have infinitely many elements.
For example, consider the collection of all integers,

$$ \left\{ ... -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ... \right\}.$$

For ChE 4220, Data Science in Chemical Engineering, we were tasked with a final project using the techniques we covered in the class to explore a dataset of our choice.

[Project Here](https://github.com/mohan-s1/lammps_work/blob/9793506a89e6bf689115417e5d5304fb69332e11/che_for_ds_final_project.ipynb)

## General Description 

For many scientists, the Ising Model presents a comprehensible chemical and physical introduction to a system in which one can explore the effects of inter-particle interactions causing correlations between the particles. In particular, this model considers N spins, $s_{\pm 1}$, arranged on a lattice. Additionally, the effects of an external magnetic field, H, and coupling constant J are considered. Broadly speaking, it is one of few analytically solvable models and offers tremendous insight into phase transition behavior in the field of statistical mechanics.

# A folder for housing relevant MSDS supplementary materials 

This folder houses supplementary materials I feel would be useful to show the breadth of my nerdiness. Most things are notes for talks I've given while the one outlier is a syllabus for the Data Science for Chemical engineering course.

`linear_talk.pdf` are the notes from the inaugural talk of STEM for VA acting as an introduction to linear algebra and its applications.

The folder `linear_code_talk` houses `linalg_talk.ipynb` which is a Juptyter Notebook, a combination of code and markdown text that I used to deliver the second STEM for VA talk introducing linear regression. 

`Group Theory Talk.pdf` is a 20-page compendium used as presentation notes for the grad student STEM public speaking group I attend as well. The theory of groups is a powerful one born out of abstraction and made "practical" through its applications in chemical bonding theory and cryptography among other things.

`Chemical Thermo.pdf` is the last addition, acting as a high-level introduction for the thermodynamics that describe the favorability of chemical reactions.
